Spinning up Apache Airflow webserver on local with the help of Docker containers. - 
a very handuy and light method to get Airflow up and running without having to create so many directories or virtual environments.

Thanks to the reference on the blog=medium.

mkdir Astro-Airflow && cd Astro-Airflow

astro dev init (from within Astro-Airflow)


ls

README.md		include			requirements.txt
